# Timer Challenge App

## Description

The Timer Challenge app is a React-based web application that provides users with a series of timer challenges. Each timer challenge has a specific duration, and users must click a button within that duration to win the challenge. If the user fails to click the button in time, they lose the challenge.

The app features multiple timer challenges, each with its own duration and difficulty level. Users can start a challenge by clicking on the corresponding button and must react quickly to click the button again before the time runs out. After each challenge, the app displays the user's score based on their performance.
